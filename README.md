<!-- Tetris gameplay 
it is straightforward. 
You'll be presented with a rectangular game board, and different shaped blocks (called tetrominos) will descend from the top of the screen. Your goal is to manipulate and set  these blocks to fit them neatly into rows at the bottom of the screen so that they can be arranged and make the given sentences the more you make meaningful sentence the more blocks will disappar and you will score points on the basis of that 
. When you complete a row, it disappears, and you earn points.


IMP.. The game continues until the stack of blocks reaches the top of the screen.
